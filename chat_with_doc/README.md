CHAT_WITH_DOC 
#  ------------

This simple .py script uses Langchain to enhance an LLM (in this case OpenAI gpt) to allow the user to tune the model to be able to chat with (Q&A) any .txt file (in this case a proposed bill to be sent to congress from congress.gov, bill.txt)

Just replace docs\bill.txt with the .txt file you wish to chat with & pass the query you wish to pass to the model
